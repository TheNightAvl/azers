```

### Run Simulations
```bash
cd simulations/monte_carlo

## Game Rules

- Two players (A and B) start with one token each
- Players can DROP, HOP, or SWAP tokens
- Win conditions:
  - **EXILE**: Occupy 3 or 4 centre squares
  - **MASSACRE**: Capture all opponent tokens
  - **DEFENCE**: Force opponent into a position with no legal moves
- Draw conditions:
  - **BOREDOM**: Repetitive moves detected
  - **OPPOSITION** (optional): Centre four squares form an alternating pattern:
    ```
    A B    or    B A
    B A          A B
    ```

## Controls

- Select tokens by number when you have multiple
- Choose moves by number from the available options
- Enter positions as column-row (e.g., B2, A1, D4)

## Visual Board Display System

### Compact Grid Format

All simulations now use a compact 3-line visual board representation:

```
--- Final Board State ---
   A B C D
1  A B A B   ‚Üê Row 1: Tokens or dots (.) for empty
2  B . . A   ‚Üê Row 2: Clear visual layout  
3  . A B .   ‚Üê Row 3: Easy pattern recognition
4  B A A B
Winner: Player A (EXILE)
```

### Smart Display Logic

- **Mode 1 Games**: Shows final board states only (opposing corners start A1 vs D4 is standard)
- **Mode 2 Games**: Shows both starting and final boards (starting positions vary significantly)
- **Interesting Games**: Final boards automatically shown for draws, long games (‚â•25 moves), or significant position changes
- **Progress Summaries**: Visual board grids included in frequent progress updates (every 5-10 games)

### Display Benefits
