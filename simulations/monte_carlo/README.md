# Azers Monte Carlo Simulation Suite

This directory contains Monte Carlo simulation tools to analyse the balance and bias of the Azers board game under different play styles, including an advanced AI learning system with machine learning capabilities.

## Overview

The simulation suite allows you to configure:
- **Number of games per configuration** (100 to 1,000,000)
- **Search depth for tactical play** (1-15)
- **AI learning parameters** (training games, evaluation games, learning modes)
- **Machine learning features** (pattern recognition, opponent modelling)
- **Automatic time estimation** before starting

Each simulation can test multiple configurations:
- **Mode 1**: Start at opposing corners (A1, D4)
- **Mode 2**: All possible starting positions
- **Opposition rule**: With/without additional draw condition

For Mode 2, all possible starting position pairs are tested (excluding rotational/reflectional symmetries).

## Board Display System ‚≠ê **ENHANCED**

The simulation suite includes comprehensive board visualisation with compact grid format:

### Smart Display Logic
- **End-of-Game States**: All simulations show final board positions for interesting games in compact grid format
- **Mode 1** (opposing corners): Shows final boards only (starting position A1 vs D4 is standard)
- **Mode 2** (all positions): Shows both starting and final boards (starting positions vary significantly)
- **Conditional Display**: Starting boards only shown for Mode 2 games to avoid redundancy

### Compact Grid Format
```
--- Final Board State ---
   A B C D
1  A B A B   ‚Üê Clear visual token layout
2  B . . A   ‚Üê Dots represent empty squares  
3  . A B .   ‚Üê Easy pattern recognition
4  B A A B
Winner: Player A (EXILE), 28 moves
```

### Display Criteria
- **Always shown**: Interesting games from each simulation with visual board grids
- **Interesting games**: 
  - Draws (any length)
  - Long games (‚â• 25 moves for learning AI, ‚â• 30 moves for others)
  - Games with significant position changes (token swings ‚â• 2)
  - Games with centre control changes (‚â• 2 centre square changes)

### Frequent Progress Updates

- Lower draw rates due to better play
- Shorter average game length
- More decisive outcomes

## Performance Notes

- Random simulations: ~1000-2000 games/second
- Tactical simulations: ~5-20 games/second depending on CPU

## Interpreting Bias Results

- **< 2% bias**: Well balanced
- **2-5% bias**: Slightly biased  
- **5-10% bias**: Moderately biased
- **> 10% bias**: Heavily biased

The Opposition rule may significantly affect game balance by providing an additional draw condition.
